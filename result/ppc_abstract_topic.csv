This claim is based upon measurements of weak attractive forces between a mica surface and a gold surface across ILs, attributed to double-layer attraction. From the decay length of the attractive force (1013 nm), an effective free-ion concentration is deduced by fitting to a modified DerjaguinLandauVerweyOverbeek (DLVO) theoretical expression. However, the overwhelming evidence from the thermodynamic and transport properties of similar ILs is that they are not composed of neutral ion pairs with simple dissociation equilibria, and, as such, the DLVO framework is inappropriate. Rather, the liquid should be considered as strongly dissociated with ions interacting to varying extents with several nearby counterions (2, 3). The authors support their assertion of weak dissociation by calculating the binding energy of an ion pair, relative to isolated ions in a dielectric medium.

However, eutrophication has increased in many coastal marine ecosystems since the 1970s, including the Chesapeake Bay, Long Island Sound, and the Gulf of Mexico Dead Zone. Why? Nitrogen contributes to eutrophication in these ecosystems, and nitrogen pollution has grown tremendously since the 1970s (2, 3).
Unfortunately, Schindler et al. (1) generalize their lake results to estuarine and coastal ecosystems, suggesting that the controls on eutrophication in lakes and coastal waters are the same. If this is true, reducing nitrogen in coastal systems could cause blooms of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, as occurs in many lakes. Substantial research over 2 decades demonstrates that this premise is wrong, and in most estuaries and coastal waters worldwide with salinities exceeding 68, planktonic, nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria do not occur because their growth is controlled by factors other than phosphorus supply (24).

The core of their hypothesis is that sialylation of IgG Fc leads to a conformational change, which triggers DC-SIGN binding. To directly assess this hypothesis, we have generated ?2,6-sialylated IgG1 Fc (sFc) that we both chemically verified by HPLC analysis (Fig. 1A) and structurally characterized by X-ray crystallographic analysis to a resolution of 2.3 Å (Fig. 1 B and C, and Table 1).
Our crystallographic analysis also shows that Fc sialylation does not perturb the classic proteincarbohydrate interactions observed of asialylated IgG Fc (Fig. 1C). We note that these observations are consistent with solution-state NMR measurements (3). We observe extensive electron density corresponding to 20 monosaccharide residues (Fig. 1C). There are two sialic acid attachment sites per biantennary N-linked glycan on the 3-arm and 6-arm (Fig. 1C). There is observable electron density for sialic acid on the 6-arm and, in contrast with the proposed model by Sondermann et al.

Similarly, the 3-arm is not, as proposed, tightly immobilized to the protein surface but is instead entirely solvent exposed.

Based on these criteria, the authors convincingly establish that there is little evidence for this strict sexually dimorphic view of human brains, counter to the popular lay conception of a male and female brain.

The authors of this article have combined functional MRI and probabilistic tractography to show that higher-level language comprehension is mediated by a ventral pathway, running in an anteroposterior direction within the EmC. The data seemed convincing until I tried to reproduce their results using my own dataset obtained by using a similar spatial resolution (2 × 2 × 2 mm) (4).

We are pleased to see other researchers taking a more critical view of the nature and quality of the available evidence for early fire use and questioning what seems to be a long-held assumption that the earliest evidence for fire use marks the point at which it becomes inextricably part of hominin adaptations (2, 3). We agree that the evidence indicates that fire was not a requisite technology that allowed Early Pleistocene hominins to expand into more northerly latitudes. However, we argue that the available evidence better supports a significantly later appearance for the habitual use of fire (sometime near the end of the Late Pleistocene) and that before this fire, use was always sporadic and opportunistic. Roebroeks and Villa (1) supported their argument by showing, in figure 1 and table 1 in ref. 1, significant increases in the numbers of sites with good evidence for fire in the more recent Marine Isotope Stages (MIS), and they adjusted these data to show numbers of sites with good evidence for fire per 10,000-y increment within each MIS. A potential problem with these data is that they may simply be reflecting the overall frequency of sites per time period. We can expect that, because of ongoing taphonomic processes, there will necessarily be fewer sites the farther back in time we look. It would be more meaningful if we look at the number of site occupations with good evidence for fire relative to the total number of site occupations known for that specific time period. This finding would provide a much better indication of any changes in the frequency of fire use during the Pleistocene and perhaps indicate when fire use stopped being sporadic and became habitual. Our own work (4, 5), which includes a strong control on taphonomic factors in the visibility of fire use, clearly indicates that, as late as mid-MIS 3, Neandertals were rarely using fire during main occupations of (at least some) cave sites in Southwestern France. Specifically, at Pech de l'Azé IV and Roc de Marsal (Dordogne, France), well-preserved hearths are evident in levels associated with warm climatic conditions, but in levels associated with cold environments (MIS 4 and 3), evidence for fire is almost nonexistent, although concentrations of lithics and butchered faunal remains are high. The fact that this finding reflects a lack of fire use is best supported by frequencies of burned flints throughout the site sequences, although these data are directly paralleled by frequencies of more ephemeral fire residues (burned bone, charcoal, and ash).

Not surprisingly, they invoke the carbon-starvation hypothesis to explain their results. Although this hypothesis is appealing and tentatively supported by this and other research (3), direct evidence to support this hypothesis is completely lacking to date: actual depletion of carbon stored reserves prior to drought-induced mortality has never been shown. In contrast, there is evidence that mature trees store sufficient mobile carbon to meet fairly large competing carbon demands (4) and that reductions in water availability are associated with an increase rather than a decrease in stored mobile carbon (5). More importantly, potential alternative hypotheses for the carbon-starvation hypothesis have not been adequately addressed. For instance, carbon starvation need not be invoked if stress due to lack of water and exacerbated by warmer temperatures limits phloem function and long-distance carbon translocation within trees.

Kirkby et al.

They also ignored the functional consequences of vascular deletion of COX-2, a predisposition to thrombosis and hypertension, or that urinary PGIM (alone among the major metabolites of PGs was suppressed in these mutants) inversely correlated with the rise in blood pressure (5), consistent with the hypothesis that the hypertensive phenotype is a consequence of disruption of COX-2dependent formation of PGI2.
Kirkby et al. (1) used an immunoassay of 6-keto prostaglandin (PG)F1? to reflect PGI2.

10.1126/science.1083647,2003,"Discovery of a plastid in apicomplexan parasites such as Toxoplasma and Plasmodium (1, 2) has prompted intense debate over whether the plastid originates from a red algal or a green algal ancestor (35). Funes et al. (6) argued for a green algal ancestry based on analysis of the cox2 gene, which encodes COXII, a subunit of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV of the mitochondrial respiratory chain). Apicomplexan parasites are unusual in that COXII is encoded in the nucleus (7). In all other organisms studied, with the notable exceptions of certain green algae and leguminous plants, COXII is encoded by the mitochondrial genome (8, 9). Intriguingly, the COXII protein of apicomplexan parasites comprises two polypeptides corresponding to the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal domains of the canonical COXII. The two domains are encoded by two nuclear genes, cox2a and cox2b (7). This gene separation also occurs in certain green algae, where it appears that the cox2 gene split in the mitochondrial DNA before cox2a and cox2b transferred to the nucleus (6). Funes et al. (6) presented a phylogeny of COXII indicating that apicomplexan genes are most closely related to the cox2 genes of green algae. They further suggested that apicomplexa acquired their split cox2a and cox2b genes through lateral gene transfer (presumably nucleus to nucleus) from the endosymbiotic (green) alga that gave rise to the plastid.",0.014755894429981709,0.2071121633052826,0.38975775241851807,0.10949459671974182,0.27887964248657227

The disorder known as Ammon's horn sclerosis (AHS) is characterized by pronounced cell loss and gliosis in various regions of the hippocampal formation, leaving the subiculum generally intact (1, 2). Given the hypothesis that epileptic activity is generated within the hippocampal formation when the CA3 and CA1 regions are damaged or even absent, it is feasible that the adjacent subiculum is uniquely responsible for the generation of limbic seizures. Using multielectrode recordings in hippocampal brain slices of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and hippocampal sclerosis, Cohen et al. (3) detected spontaneous, rhythmic spikes in the subiculum but rarely in the CA3 or CA1 regions. This activity closely resembled the discharges seen on the electroencephalograms (EEGs) of these patients. Cohen et al.

Genome size can vary among bacteria by at least an order of magnitude, but the fraction of noncoding DNA is consistently low (?15%). Consequently, larger bacterial genomes are expected to result from more selection, because they maintain more functional DNA. Indeed, large genome size in bacteria commonly has been considered an adaptation to changing environments (26). Furthermore, small Ne in symbiotic bacteria appears to result in reduced genomes through gene loss (7, 8).

These authors also found that overexpression of parkin rescued neuronal cell lines under tissue-culture conditions subjected to proteasome inhibition and that this protective effect was abrogated by S-nitrosylation of parkin, thus supporting the pathophysiological relevance of this chemical reaction. Additionally, a hallmark of sporadic PD is the formation of ubiquitinated inclusions of misfolded proteins known as Lewy bodies.

Hide abstract
Screening mammography aims to identify breast cancer at earlier stages of the disease, when treatment can be more successful1. Despite the existence of screening programmes worldwide, the interpretation of mammograms is affected by high rates of false positives and false negatives2. Here we present an artificial intelligence (AI) system that is capable of surpassing human experts in breast cancer prediction. To assess its performance in the clinical setting, we curated a large representative dataset from the UK and a large enriched dataset from the USA. We show an absolute reduction of 5.7% and 1.2% (USA and UK) in false positives and 9.4% and 2.7% in false negatives. We provide evidence of the ability of the system to generalize from the UK to the USA. In an independent study of six radiologists, the AI system outperformed all of the human readers: the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) for the AI system was greater than the AUC-ROC for the average radiologist by an absolute margin of 11.5%. We ran a simulation in which the AI system participated in the double-reading process that is used in the UK, and found that the AI system maintained non-inferior performance and reduced the workload of the second reader by 88%. This robust assessment of the AI system paves the way for clinical trials to improve the accuracy and efficiency of breast cancer screening.",0.28617197275161743,0.31335321068763733,0.09715868532657623,0.08345602452754974,0.21986015141010284

10.1038/258267a0,1975,"INCREASED levels of serum dopamine-B- hydroxylase (DBH) have been reported in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Although DBH is released from sympathetic nerve endings along with noradrenaline, levels of the en- zyme in plasma do not seem to reflect accurately the degree of sympatho- adrenal activity. Plasma levels of noradrenaline mostly reflect sympa- thetic neuronal activity whence adrena- line (A) levels are indicative of adrenal medullary discharge. The con- tent of catecholamines and biosynthetic enzymes in the adrenal are presumably indices of the activity of the adrenal medulla in synthesising and releasing catecholamines. The possible role of the sympathoadrenal system in initiat- ing the increase in blood pressure in SHRs was examined by measuring levels of adrenaline and noradrenaline in the plasma and adrenal glands at the age of 4 weeks, the age at which the blood pressure of SHR begins to rise. Normotensive rats of the Wistar Kyoto strain (WKY) from which the SHRs were derived were used as controls. Activities of adrenal tyrosine hydroxy- lase (TH), DBH, and phenylethano- lamine-N-methyl transferase (PNMT), as well as plasma DBH, were also examined.
These observations are consistent with the view that, at 4 weeks of age, sympathetic neuronal activity in SHRs is increased, whereas adrenal medullary activity is depressed. Adrenal medul- lary activity is increased when sympa- thetic nerves are destroyed by 6- hydroxydopamine and it is likely that depressed adrenal medullary activity may be secondary to the increased sympathetic neuronal activity.

Spiperone, and certain other neuroleptic drugs, apparently interact with high affinity at both DA and 5-HT receptors in the CNS; our estimates of Ka values for H-spiperone binding in rat striatum (K=0.25 nM) and medial frontal cortex (Ka = 0.5 nM) indicate only a small difference in the affinity of spiperone binding at these different sites (DA and 5-HT); in human tissue the Ka for these two areas is, in fact, the same (Ka=0.5 nM). Similarly, as reported previously, the neuroleptic drug butaclamol interacts potently and stereoselectively at both these sites. Figure 1b shows that specific binding of H-spiperone, defined as that displaced by 1 µM (+)-butaclamol, is detectable in homogenates of both striatum and medial frontal cortex although (+)-butaclamol is slightly less potent in inhibiting H- spiperone binding in the cortical pre- parations. Thus, the use of the isomers of butaclamol to define 'specific' binding of H-spiperone exclusively to CNS DA receptors would clearly yield misleading results.

Bleasdale grew the same variety of ryegrass in greenhouses ventilated with polluted air from out-of-doors on a suburban site in Manchester and com- pared the growth with that in a green- house ventilated with purified air.

Bleasdale's data appear to show that S23 ryegrass is more sensitive to SO2 than is apparent from the study by Bell and Clough. This discrepancy may be the result of their having performed experiments in different conditions, but it may equally have resulted from Bell and Clough's simulated SO2 pollution rather than polluted air from outside. In Bleasdale's experiments other air pollutants would also have been present. One such is NO2. This is found in polluted atmospheres because NO is produced by combination when fossil fuels are burnt, and is quickly oxidised in air to NO2. We have recently completed some experiments in which the combined effects of SO2 and NO pollution on photosynthesis in the pea, p.p.hm. and above of both SO, and NO were found to produce visible lesions on intact plants.

Several open reading frames (ORFs) capable of encoding proteins of molecular weights greater than 10,000 were identified in both strands of DNAs 1 and 2. Interestingly, two ORFs which are capable of encoding proteins of similar sizes (molecular weights 30,100 and 29,200) are present at equivalent positions on DNAs 1 and 2. We have compared the amino acid sequences of these proteins by a computer-assisted method described previously and found that they are closely related (Fig. 1). Of all the positions com- pared in the aligned sequences, 43% are occupied by residues that are identical or chemically similar (gaps were considered as substitutions between dissimilar amino acids regardless of their length). Further- more, a statistical test shows that the simi- larity between the aligned sequences is highly significant, with a probability of occurrence by chance of 4.3×10-6. The presence of such extensive sequence simi- larity suggests that like the ORF of DNA 1, which is known to code for the coat protein of CLV (ref. 1 and J. Stanley, personal communication), the ORF of DNA 2 also encodes a functional protein. Although no such extensive sequence similarities were found for other ORFs, the present result, together with the simi- larity in size of the two viral DNAs and the fact that they share a very similar non-coding segment in common¹, also suggests that the bipartite viral genome has evolved from a single common ances- tral DNA.",0.3105485439300537,0.34057796001434326,0.1550038754940033,0.09894710779190063,0.09492248296737671
