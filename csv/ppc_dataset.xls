Exposure experiments, like the study of Sussarellu et al. (1) recently published in PNAS, may provide such insights. However, the results of dose–response experiments must always be interpreted in light of environmental concentrations, and the experimental concentrations examined by Sussarellu et al. (1) and several others (2–8) are orders-of-magnitude higher than those reported from field studies (Fig. 1)."

, compared with the nominal 
).” For comparison, their own nonparametric method’s results actually showed up to 40% FPR. When characterizing results, medians or percentile ranges are generally more informative summary statistics than maxima. Looking backward, the typical ranges show much smaller FPR inflation than what had been highlighted, and looking forward they provide useful suggestions for experimental design and analyses (lower voxelwise 
, event-related paradigms, etc.). By concentrating on the highest observed FPRs, the conclusions of Eklund et al. (1) are unnecessarily alarmist."

Electrophysiological and optogenetic studies have identified neuronal populations activated during foraging behavior, attention, emotion, reward expectancy, skeletomotor and visceromotor activity, and other functions (e.g., refs. 2–5). Only a small minority of dACC neurons are pain-related."

(1) conclude that local aerosol nucleation and growth dominantly contributed to severe haze in Beijing, whereas regional transport of PM2.5 played an “insignificant” role. Guo et al.’s conclusion is surprising because it not only requires an uncharacteristic aerosol formation mode for Beijing, but also goes against a broadly held view that “the entire eastern China region, or at least the North China Plain” should be looked at “as a single air basin” if Beijing’s air quality is to be improved (2). Instead of curtailing the emission of aerosol precursor gases in a broader region, Guo et al.’s (1) conclusion would advocate a campaign on limiting traffic and emission within and around the immediate vicinity of Beijing. Already, Beijing’s municipal government has increased urban traffic controls as its number one tactic in an effort to reduce PM2.5.* However, we believe that an in-depth scrutiny of the data makes science more accurate and science-based actions more efficient."

(1)], there is indeed an increase in the nongrowing season Système Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) NDVI for the steppes and meadows in the TP. After eliminating the impact of nongrowing season NDVI increase, we found no change of green-up dates in 2009–2011 compared with that in 1998–2000 (Fig. 1B). A similar result was also found using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI data (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, because the green-up onset in the TP usually occurs in May and June during the period from 1998 to 2011 (1, 3, 4), the advance in green-up dates should result in an increase in the difference of NDVI between May and April, according to the method for retrieving green-up dates (2). However, such increase was not found in the NDVI datasets from both SPOT and MODIS (Fig. 1D). Therefore, so far, there is no evidence for the continuously advancing trend of green-up dates in the TP over the last decade. The continuously advancing trend of green-up dates revealed by Zhang et al. (1) is likely caused by not correcting for the increased nongrowing season NDVI."
2-s2.0-84881086801,PNAS,10.1073/pnas.1306157110,2013,10.1073/pnas.1210423110,2013,Green-up dates in the Tibetan Plateau have continuously advanced from 1982 to 2012,"To quantify the change in snow cover on the Tibet Plateau, we used snow cover fraction (SCF, %) from 0.05 degree MODIS/Terra 8-Day Snow Cover dataset from 2000 to 2011. Our analyses showed that SCF during January–April decreased from 2000 to 2011 over a majority of pixels (Fig. 1A), which caused the corresponding NDVI to rise (Fig. 1 B and C). This rise in NDVI can be expected because the presence of snow can diminish NDVI (5). More importantly, we found that the extracted SOS from Zhang et al. (1) was not only negatively correlated with NDVI in May (MODIS, R2 = 0.36, P < 0.05; SPOT-VGT, R2 = 0.61, P < 0.01) when the onset of growing season on the Tibetan Plateau mainly occurred (1, 2), but also negatively related to January–April NDVI (MODIS, R2 = 0.47, P < 0.05; SPOT-VGT, R2 = 0.61, P < 0.01) (Fig. 1D) during the period 2000–2011. These significant correlations suggested that advances in spring phenology observed by Zhang et al. (1) may be influenced by increasing January–April NDVI values due to the declining snow cover. Thus, snow cover change in nongrowing season should not be dismissed in detection of long-term trends in spring phenology."

(1) reported that subtoxic doses of H2O2 fails to activate nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) in astrocytes and triggers Nrf2-independent responses that protect cocultured neurons. Contrary to this, we show that mild oxidative insults, including subtoxic H2O2, strongly activate astrocytic Nrf2/antioxidant response element (ARE)-dependent gene expression, which, moreover, contributes to neuroprotective ischemic preconditioning."

(1) recently published a comprehensive study showing substantial impacts of climate change on viticultural suitability, leading to potential ecological issues. We agree that expansion of viticulture into new areas can lead to a decrease in biodiversity and that an increase in water use for irrigation might lead to major freshwater conservation impacts. However, we disagree with the alarming statement that suitability for winegrowing of main wine-producing areas worldwide will dramatically decrease over the next 40 y. We point out major methodological flaws in ref. 1, mostly linked to (i) the misuse of bibliographical data to compute suitability index, (ii) underestimation of adaptations of viticulture to warmer conditions, and (iii) the inadequacy of the monthly time step in the suitability approach."

Despite its popularity, the “nudge approach” has been criticized for having a “limited evidence base” (e.g., ref. 2). Mertens et al. (3) seek to address that limitation with a timely and comprehensive metaanalysis. Mertens et al.’s headline finding is that “choice architecture [nudging] is an effective and widely applicable behavior change tool” (p. 8). We propose their finding of “moderate publication bias” (p. 1) is the real headline; when this publication bias is appropriately corrected for, no evidence for the effectiveness of nudges remains (Fig. 1)."

(1) proposed nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences as the sole universal barcode for fungi. The work by Schoch et al. (1) stated that “the proposal will satisfy most fungal biologists but not all” (1).
I am among those biologists who are not so satisfied and not really surprised either, because ITS has been the most widely used marker for species identifications in mycology since the development of the first universal primers to amplify this DNA region in fungi. Its use as an unofficial fungal species barcode has also been criticized (2). It was also criticized because of its limits, including intraspecific variation. This aspect was discussed in the work by Schoch et al. (1) from different perspectives except one: the methodological dimension of revealing intraspecific variation in the ITS region."

This claim is based upon measurements of weak attractive forces between a mica surface and a gold surface across ILs, attributed to double-layer attraction. From the decay length of the attractive force (10–13 nm), an effective free-ion concentration is deduced by fitting to a modified Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek (DLVO) theoretical expression. However, the overwhelming evidence from the thermodynamic and transport properties of similar ILs is that they are not composed of neutral ion pairs with simple dissociation equilibria, and, as such, the DLVO framework is inappropriate. Rather, the liquid should be considered as strongly dissociated with ions interacting to varying extents with several nearby counterions (2, 3). The authors support their assertion of weak dissociation by calculating the binding energy of an ion pair, relative to isolated ions in a dielectric medium. However, they do not contrast this with the energetics of a dense, locally charge-ordered ionic melt that is the likely state of the fluid. In the same limited framework, NaCl would be expected to be an ion-pair fluid."

Quantifying the sources and sinks of N to the ocean is essential for predicting its productivity and potential carbon sequestration. In his paper, Gruber (1) seeks for “elusive marine nitrogen fixation” following results from Knapp et al. (2), who measured unexpectedly low N input through N2 fixation in the eastern tropical South Pacific (ETSP), seriously bringing into question the proposed close spatial coupling between N input (through N2 fixation) and loss (through denitrification) (3). Here, we compile data from recently published and unpublished studies revealing a hot spot of N2 fixation in the western tropical South Pacific (WTSP) arguing for a spatial decoupling between N sources and sinks in the South Pacific."

In response, in the 1970s governments began to reduce phosphorus inputs, and water quality in many lakes improved dramatically. However, eutrophication has increased in many coastal marine ecosystems since the 1970s, including the Chesapeake Bay, Long Island Sound, and the Gulf of Mexico “Dead Zone.” Why? Nitrogen contributes to eutrophication in these ecosystems, and nitrogen pollution has grown tremendously since the 1970s (2, 3).
Unfortunately, Schindler et al. (1) generalize their lake results to estuarine and coastal ecosystems, suggesting that the controls on eutrophication in lakes and coastal waters are the same. If this is true, reducing nitrogen in coastal systems could cause blooms of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, as occurs in many lakes. Substantial research over 2 decades demonstrates that this premise is wrong, and in most estuaries and coastal waters worldwide with salinities exceeding 6–8‰, planktonic, nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria do not occur because their growth is controlled by factors other than phosphorus supply (2–4). At least 1 of these other controls (grazing) apparently is relaxed in offshore waters such as the Mid-Pacific Gyre in which Trichodesmium fixes significant quantities of nitrogen. But the nitrogen fixers are missing from most estuaries and coastal seas."

(1) reported that the beginning of vegetation growing season (BGS) of the alpine steppe and meadow on the Tibetan Plateau was delayed since the mid-1990s under warming winter and spring (1). They wrote that “this delay appeared to be related to later fulfillment of chilling requirements,” and they suggested that “continued warming may strengthen this effect or even reverse the advancing trend in spring phenology” (1).
This idea was proposed earlier for phenology of some species (2) and was tested on the alpine vegetations at the regional level. Using this idea, if winter warming continues and spring warming does not accelerate, the delaying trend should continue. We found, however, that, despite the continued winter warming and the fluctuating spring temperature (Tspring is the mean temperature of April, May, and June) during the period from 1998 to 2009, BGS calculated from Systeme Probatoire d'Observation dela Tarre Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) showed no continued delaying trend (Fig. 1)."

(1) reported an interesting but unexpected result that spring phenology initiated retreating in the mid-1990s, despite continued warming for grasslands (both steppe and meadow) on the Tibetan Plateau, and shortening the length of the growing season of the steppe together with an advancing end. Although we have not observed the same phenomenon in our own many years of field studies on the eastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau, we believed that there were indeed some complicated yet poorly understood dynamics and processes in the phenology on the Tibetan Plateau. However, we believe their causes should include factors such as grassland degradation, thawing–freezing processes, climate warming, and their combined effect rather than a sole factor of climate change, like winter and spring warming."

(1) misunderstand the work they criticize, mischaracterize multiple lines of research, and selectively ignore much evidence. While largely recycling prior criticisms, they provide no new models, evidence, or explanations (2)."

While in carbon footprinting weighting between various greenhouse gases according to global warming potentials is needed, we think that a distinction between the various origins of water use is useful, because the resulting environmental impacts vary largely from region to region. For instance, 1 L of water consumed in the Colorado watershed does not compare to 1 L of water from the Mississippi, because water is much more scarce in the Colorado watershed. Therefore, an extension of the work performed by Gerbens-Leenes and colleagues seems necessary to us, to capture environmental relevance. To clarify our view, a water footprint scheme consistent to that of carbon footprinting in terms of the relevant features is presented in Table 1. It deviates, in part, from the water footprint as presented by Gerbens-Leenes et al. and shows that a further discussion of the concept is necessary."

The core of their hypothesis is that sialylation of IgG Fc leads to a conformational change, which triggers DC-SIGN binding. To directly assess this hypothesis, we have generated ?2,6-sialylated IgG1 Fc (sFc) that we both chemically verified by HPLC analysis (Fig. 1A) and structurally characterized by X-ray crystallographic analysis to a resolution of 2.3 Å (Fig. 1 B and C, and Table 1).
Our crystallographic analysis also shows that Fc sialylation does not perturb the classic protein–carbohydrate interactions observed of asialylated IgG Fc (Fig. 1C). We note that these observations are consistent with solution-state NMR measurements (3). We observe extensive electron density corresponding to 20 monosaccharide residues (Fig. 1C). There are two sialic acid attachment sites per biantennary N-linked glycan on the “3-arm” and “6-arm” (Fig. 1C). There is observable electron density for sialic acid on the 6-arm and, in contrast with the proposed model by Sondermann et al. (2), this glycan moiety projects in a solvent-exposed manner away from the protein surface. Similarly, the 3-arm is not, as proposed, tightly immobilized to the protein surface but is instead entirely solvent exposed.
We note that the experimental support for the proposed conformational changes includes circular dichroism, which gives exquisitely sensitive readouts to changes in local but not tertiary or quaternary structure. In addition, the melting temperature shift observed by Sondermann et al. (2) is well within the range of other Fc glycoforms, whereas deglycosylation leads to a more significant change in stability (4)."

(1) demonstrated that the probability of extremely hot summers has markedly increased because the mean of the distribution of seasonally averaged temperatures has increased. However, the authors also implied that the variance of the distribution has increased, a result that differs from regional studies that show changes in the extremes are consistent with a simple shift in the mean (2, 3). Here we extend the spatially aggregated distribution analysis of Hansen et al. to show that once issues related to normalizations, trends, and reductions in surface-station density are accounted for, there is no indication that variability about the mean has increased, at least using these methods and data."

This claim is made on the basis of small-angle x-ray scattering data and x-ray absorption/emission data. For a single component fluid, the Q = 0 value of the structure factor, S(Q), is given by

where N is the number of molecules in any given volume of the fluid and the angle brackets indicate ensemble averages. Diverging density fluctuations near a critical point cause S(Q) to rise substantially at low Q. Does the small low-Q rise in S(Q) observed in noncritical ambient water justify the claim made in (1) that water is heterogeneous on some length scale? We think not."

(1) reported that species–climate associations estimated with envelope models were no better than expected by chance for 68% of the European birds studied. Beale et al. estimated species–climate associations with 4 variables, including soil water availability and ignored ?11% of the available bird species records for Europe, i.e., all probable and confirmed records with <10 breeding pairs and all possible breeding records.
We agree with Beale et al. (1) that there are algorithmic as well as ecological uncertainties with envelope models (4–6). However, we found no evidence that species–climate associations among European birds and climate are no stronger than expected by chance. Their conclusions are, therefore, overstated."

(4) recently demonstrate that SIGN-R1, a C-type lectin receptor on mouse splenic macrophages, recognizes and mediates anti-inflammatory effects of sialylated IgG Fc. In addition, the authors report that sialylated IgG Fc proteins also bind to DC-SIGN, the human orthologue of SIGN-R1. However, it is important to note that DC-SIGN and SIGNR1 differ significantly in their cellular and tissue distribution. Because DC-SIGN is expressed specifically on human dendritic cells (DC), we sought to explore whether DC-SIGN and ?2,6-sialylated IgG Fc interaction is indispensable for the anti-inflammatory effect of IVIg in the context of human DC.
Interestingly, we found that both intact IVIg and F(ab?)2 fragments of IVIg that lacks the Fc region, and hence lacking terminal ?2,6-sialic acid linkages, inhibit TLR-mediated activation of DC as assessed by phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (Fig. 1), an intracellular signaling molecule that mediates inflammatory response of DC upon interaction with TLR agonists. The results suggest that DC-SIGN and ?2,6-sialylated IgG Fc interaction is dispensable for the anti-inflammatory activity of IVIg on human DC. In fact, we found that IVIg also targets CD40 on human DC (5). Therefore, caution should be exercised while translating results from murine models to patients."

(1) recently asserted that patients with bilateral hippocampal damage can imagine future experiences. This contradicts a number of previous reports where amnesia and bilateral hippocampal lesions have been found to cause significant impairment in imagining fictitious and future scenarios (2–4).

(1) discussed in a recent issue of PNAS.

(1) demonstrate extensive overlap between the distributions of females and males for many brain characteristics, measured across multiple neuroimaging modalities and datasets. They pose two requirements for categorizing brains into distinct male/female classes: (i) gender differences should appear as dimorphic form differences between male and female brains, and (ii) there should be internal consistency in the degree of “maleness–femaleness” of different elements within a single brain. Based on these criteria, the authors convincingly establish that there is little evidence for this strict sexually dimorphic view of human brains, counter to the popular lay conception of a “male” and “female” brain. This finding has broad implications not only for the ontology of gender, but also for the statistical treatment of sex in morphometric analyses.
Despite the absence of dimorphic differences and lack of internal consistency observed by Joel et al. (1), multivariate analyses of whole-brain patterns in brain morphometry can reliably discriminate sex. These two results are not mutually inconsistent. We wholly agree that a strict dichotomy between male/female brains does not exist, but this does not diminish or negate the importance of considering statistical differences between the sexes (e.g., including sex as a covariate in morphometric analyses)."

(1) highlights the importance of demography for analyzing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)–related mortality. The authors underscore the role of population age structure and intergenerational contacts for understanding differences in cross-country fatality and estimate the potential impact of the pandemic on different populations, acknowledging the need for additional information on the prevalence of comorbidities. We aim to interpret the proposed scenarios considering the widely different prevalence of chronic conditions by age in three of the countries discussed in the original paper. We argue that the burden of chronic diseases has the potential to offset the possible benefits of younger populations with different epidemiological characteristics."

(1) argue that both historical and near-term (through 2050) cumulative emissions are more in line with Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) than other RCPs (2), and take issue with our suggestion (3) that the treatment of the scenario as “business as usual” is misleading.
The match to near-term cumulative emissions that Schwalm et al. find is due to compensating errors of too-high fossil CO2 emissions and too-low land use emissions. The extended IEA WEO scenarios (4) they develop include future land-use emissions assumptions at odds with emissions in both the RCPs and the new SSPs. The SSPs—which are being used by researchers going forward—show that the SSP4-6.0 and SSP2-4.5 scenarios agree much better with near-term cumulative emissions than the SSP5-8.5 scenario when using the Schwalm et al. approach."

We are pleased to see other researchers taking a more critical view of the nature and quality of the available evidence for early fire use and questioning what seems to be a long-held assumption that the earliest evidence for fire use marks the point at which it becomes inextricably part of hominin adaptations (2, 3). We agree that the evidence indicates that fire was not a requisite technology that allowed Early Pleistocene hominins to expand into more northerly latitudes. However, we argue that the available evidence better supports a significantly later appearance for the habitual use of fire (sometime near the end of the Late Pleistocene) and that before this fire, use was always sporadic and opportunistic. Roebroeks and Villa (1) supported their argument by showing, in figure 1 and table 1 in ref. 1, significant increases in the numbers of sites with good evidence for fire in the more recent Marine Isotope Stages (MIS), and they adjusted these data to show numbers of sites with good evidence for fire per 10,000-y increment within each MIS. A potential problem with these data is that they may simply be reflecting the overall frequency of sites per time period. We can expect that, because of ongoing taphonomic processes, there will necessarily be fewer sites the farther back in time we look. It would be more meaningful if we look at the number of site occupations with good evidence for fire relative to the total number of site occupations known for that specific time period. This finding would provide a much better indication of any changes in the frequency of fire use during the Pleistocene and perhaps indicate when fire use stopped being sporadic and became habitual. Our own work (4, 5), which includes a strong control on taphonomic factors in the visibility of fire use, clearly indicates that, as late as mid-MIS 3, Neandertals were rarely using fire during main occupations of (at least some) cave sites in Southwestern France. Specifically, at Pech de l'Azé IV and Roc de Marsal (Dordogne, France), well-preserved hearths are evident in levels associated with warm climatic conditions, but in levels associated with cold environments (MIS 4 and 3), evidence for fire is almost nonexistent, although concentrations of lithics and butchered faunal remains are high. The fact that this finding reflects a lack of fire use is best supported by frequencies of burned flints throughout the site sequences, although these data are directly paralleled by frequencies of more ephemeral fire residues (burned bone, charcoal, and ash). We would argue that, if Neandertals had the ability to make fire at will, then evidence for it should occur with much greater frequency in Middle Paleolithic sites and occupations and especially, those sites associated with such cold stages."

Methane in aquifers located above the shale strata, for instance, in Pennsylvania, United States, has been attributed by some to be the result of contamination caused by the hydraulic fracturing process. The work by Osborn et al. (1) described geochemical data from 68 drinking water wells in northeastern Pennsylvania and upstate New York and evaluated whether the aquifers that the water wells penetrated were contaminated with thermogenic methane sourced from the underlying Marcellus and Utica shale formations. The work by Osborn et al. (1) concluded that contamination had occurred and that the contamination accompanied gas well drilling and hydraulic fracturing. The inference from the text and title of the paper is clear—hydraulic fracturing had a role. However, the evidential basis for implicating this specific process is not sound and needs to be closely scrutinized."

Elsewhere Mekonnen and Hoekstra (ref. 2, p. 413) used the same kind of virtual water assessment to argue that the “…water footprint of any animal product is larger than the water footprint of crop products with equivalent nutritional value.” However, by our reasoning, livestock raised on nonarable land and without irrigation have a negligible impact on water resources (except perhaps through erosion and sedimentation if overgrazing is permitted), despite making a substantial contribution to global food production.

The authors state that they succeeded in in vivo depiction of the dual-stream model for language processing, which has been recently suggested by Hickok et al. (2, 3). These fibers are known to course through the extreme capsule (EmC), which is a fiber bundle that is located lateral to the external capsule (EC), divided by a thin layer of gray matter known as the claustrum. The authors of this article have combined functional MRI and probabilistic tractography to show that higher-level language comprehension is mediated by a ventral pathway, running in an anteroposterior direction within the EmC. The data seemed convincing until I tried to reproduce their results using my own dataset obtained by using a similar spatial resolution (2 × 2 × 2 mm) (4). By carefully looking into the color-coded vector map (Fig. 1), I immediately noticed that the fiber direction of the EmC is not anteroposterior but rather transverse or superoinferior in the transaxial plane (indicated by the deep purple color). On the other hand, the EC had fibers running in an anteroposterior direction (shown in green). It thus seems that their probabilistic tractography has erroneously picked the EC (rather than the EmC) to elucidate an imaginary fiber tract connecting the temporal lobe and the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. As a clinician, I have been using this tool (tractography) with the greatest caution, because all that we see on these intriguing images may not precisely reflect the reality (5). I think that the results of Saur et al. (1) represent another example of such false positive/negative results."

However, birds select habitats mainly based on vegetation structure and floristic composition (2). Catalonian high altitudes are dominated by uniform coniferous forests or simple habitats with low vegetation cover (outcrops, grasslands, and scrublands) that are known to be poor in bird richness. Furthermore, high-altitude grid cells have the largest altitudinal ranges but much fewer habitats than lower altitudes (using 48 habitat categories obtained from Inventario Nacional Forestal III, 2007–2008, Spanish Ministerio de Medio Ambiente)."

It predicts an eventual depletion of tree carbon stores as a result of stomatal closure and insufficient carbon assimilation to meet carbon demands for tissue maintenance. Consistent with this, Adams et al. (2) show that drought-stressed Pinus edulis grown at experimentally induced warmer temperatures (?4 °C) incur greater respiratory carbon loss and die earlier than drought-stressed trees grown at ambient temperature. Not surprisingly, they invoke the carbon-starvation hypothesis to explain their results. Although this hypothesis is appealing and tentatively supported by this and other research (3), direct evidence to support this hypothesis is completely lacking to date: actual depletion of carbon stored reserves prior to drought-induced mortality has never been shown. In contrast, there is evidence that mature trees store sufficient mobile carbon to meet fairly large competing carbon demands (4) and that reductions in water availability are associated with an increase rather than a decrease in stored mobile carbon (5). More importantly, potential alternative hypotheses for the carbon-starvation hypothesis have not been adequately addressed. For instance, carbon starvation need not be invoked if stress due to lack of water and exacerbated by warmer temperatures limits phloem function and long-distance carbon translocation within trees. This distinction is critical and not a matter of semantics. Testing alternative hypotheses is fundamental to advance research in tree physiology to fully understand tree, forest, and ecosystem responses to global change."

We disagree, however, with the conclusion that %N–NIR correlations are necessarily spurious. On the contrary, they are consistent with ample evidence that canopy architecture and leaf structural and chemical and optical properties tend to covary among plant functional types (2–4), and we can exploit this tendency for the purposes of prediction and mapping. We are also troubled by certain sweeping and somewhat misleading generalizations, such as the purported implications of the authors’ findings for all imaging spectroscopy. The analyses focused primarily on 800- to 850-nm albedo, and, thus, it is unclear whether the results are applicable to narrow-waveband (e.g., 10 nm) and full-spectrum (e.g., 400–2500 nm) studies, especially because the signature of leaf-level variation in foliar nutrients, such as nitrogen, is most prominent in shortwave infrared regions (>1,100 nm) that were not addressed by the authors (2, 3)."

This bias mainly lies in a nonrepresentative selection of CF. Gattinger et al. compared systems with high stocking densities and C inputs to systems with low stocking densities and C return, which they called “organic” vs. “nonorganic” but which actually represent mixed farming vs. almost stockless systems, respectively.

The recent paper by Forster et al. (1) analyzed 160 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) full genomes available (https://www.gisaid.org/) in early March 2020. The central claim is the identification of three main SARS-CoV-2 types, named A, B, and C, circulating in different proportions among Europeans and Americans (types A and C) and East Asians (type B). According to a median-joining network analysis, variant A is proposed to be the ancestral type because it links to the sequence of a coronavirus from bats, used as an outgroup to trace the ancestral origin of the human strains. The authors further suggest that the “ancestral Wuhan B-type virus is immunologically or environmentally adapted to a large section of the East Asian population, and may need to mutate to overcome resistance outside East Asia.” There are several serious flaws with their findings and interpretation. First, and most obviously, the sequence identity between SARS-CoV-2 and the bat virus is only 96.2%, implying that these viral genomes (which are nearly 30,000 nucleotides long) differ by more than 1,000 mutations. Such a distant outgroup is unlikely to provide a reliable root for the network. Yet, strangely, the branch to the bat virus, in figure 1 of their paper, is only 16 or 17 mutations in length. Indeed, the network seems to be misrooted, because (see their SI Appendix, figure S4) a virus from Wuhan from week 0 (24 December 2019) is portrayed as a descendant of a clade of viruses collected in weeks 1 to 9 (presumably from many places outside China), which makes no evolutionary (2) or epidemiological sense (3)."

The most important is that the board tries to complete all cases from one prison before it takes a break and to start with another prison after the break.

SAMHD1 is deactivated in proliferating cells by a mechanism that requires phosphorylation of SAMHD1 (3). Allouch et al.

(1) found that the trend of advancing spring phenology for alpine steppe and meadow was reversed around 2000, despite the increasing air temperature over the Tibetan Plateau. This phenomenon cannot be explained by changes in precipitation or snow melt. They speculated that the lack of fulfillment of a chilling requirement caused by warming winters could be the reason. This might have significant implications for the ecosystem and economy of the Tibetan Plateau. However, we offer an alternative hypothesis for the delay of spring phenology after 2000: the increasing contamination in spring over the Tibetan Plateau could be the reason."

(1) recently report the discovery of 16 Food and Drug Administration–approved drugs as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) main protease (Mpro) inhibitors. They were identified from a computational virtual screening approach using the Mpro as the drug target, and their enzymatic inhibition against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was validated in the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based enzymatic assay (inhibitory constant Ki = 0.04 to 3.27 µM). Overall, our data suggest that there might be a significant flaw with the enzymatic assay inhibition results presented in this study. None of the identified hits was confirmed to inhibit or bind to SARS-Co-2 Mpro. A GST-tagged Mpro was used in their enzymatic assay; however, it is known that Mpro requires a native N terminus to form the enzymatic active dimer (4). DTT was not added in the enzymatic assay, but the nonspecific reactivity did not explain the results presented in the paper, as we did not observe significant enzymatic inhibition even in the absence of DTT for six of the tested compounds (Fig. 1B)."

We suspected an aggregation bias and examined whether the increase in aggregate mortality rates could be due to the changing composition of this age group. Adjusting for age confirmed this suspicion.

Instead there is an increasing trend from 1999 to 2005 and a constant trend thereafter. Moreover, stratifying age-adjusted mortality rates by sex shows a marked increase only for women and not men, contrary to the article’s headline."

This assertion of the authors was false when made in 1995, and since then considerable collaborative work between the experimental and theoretical communities has made an irrefutable case against the notion that the only way proteins fold is by a single obligate pathway (ref. 3 and references therein), as implied in Englander and Mayne’s article (1).

Complement activation has long been implicated in the pathogenesis of ALS, with numerous clinical and animal studies demonstrating strong complement factor up-regulation, including C1q and C3, in regions of motor neuron death (2). Intriguingly, in the study by Lobsiger et al. C3- (and C1q-) deleted SOD1 mice did not show alterations in survival or motor neuron estimates, and this is interpreted by the authors as complement activation not contributing to ALS mice neurotoxicity. Indeed, in figure S1 of their article, Lobsiger et al. present three C3-dependent pathways of complement activation (classic, lectin, and alternative). However, one point missing in this report, and perhaps overlooked by the casual reader, is that there is now a well-described fourth pathway of complement activation, termed the “extrinsic pathway,” which can bypass the traditional upstream activation pathways that are reliant on complement factor C3."

(1) recently reported a negative association between brainstem serotonin transporters and personality traits such as honesty and rejection to unfairness. They interpret their locus within brainstem to include the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) (1). Other than DRN, the median raphe nucleus (MRN) also projects to the forebrain and may be equally important in the serotonergic modulation of cortical activity. Hence, several studies have focused on these two midbrain raphe nuclei with respect to receptor and transporter distributions or anatomical connections. Small nuclei such as DRN and MRN are, however, exceptionally difficult to localize in human imaging research in vivo, such as positron emission tomography (PET). Given figure 2a in the work by Takahashi et al. (1), we propose that they measured serotonin transporters within the MRN rather than the DRN and suggest that MRN may be easily mistaken in imaging studies as DRN. DRN and MRN differ in several aspects, including receptor distributions and afferent and efferent connections (4), which highlights the importance of differentiating and identifying them as two separate nuclei in neuroimaging research."

Water, however, exhibits enhanced number density fluctuations both at higher and lower temperatures. Clearly, the driving force cannot be the same in both temperature regimes. In ref. 2, we suggest that the balance between minimizing enthalpy (tetrahedral regions) and entropy (disordered regions) provides the driving force dominating at low temperatures and that cooperatively enhanced H bonds associated with lower-density, tetrahedral regions may play an important role."

(1) claimed that cyclooxygenase (COX)-1, not COX-2, is the dominant source of prostacyclin (PGI2). This conclusion was based on experiments using a flawed approach to estimating enzyme activity and PGI2 formation and a selective omission of data in the literature.
Kirkby et al. (1) failed to mention that deletion of COX-2 in vascular, smooth muscle cells, or both depressed urinary PGIM, providing direct genetic evidence for the role of vascular COX-2 in PGI2 production (5). They also ignored the functional consequences of vascular deletion of COX-2, a predisposition to thrombosis and hypertension, or that urinary PGIM (alone among the major metabolites of PGs was suppressed in these mutants) inversely correlated with the rise in blood pressure (5), consistent with the hypothesis that the hypertensive phenotype is a consequence of disruption of COX-2–dependent formation of PGI2.
Kirkby et al. (1) used an immunoassay of 6-keto prostaglandin (PG)F1? to reflect PGI2. However, their reported levels (?150 ng/mL) were orders of magnitude higher than when 6-keto PGF1? is measured (<3 pg/mL) in plasma by mass spectrometry (MS) (2). The source of immunoreactivity in the study by Kirkby et al. was unknown. Polyclonal antibodies against COX-1 and COX-2 were used to compare relative expression in murine vascular tissue. Although Kirkby et al. detected COX-1, they did not see a COX-2 signal and concluded that this isoform was not expressed. However, they failed to demonstrate that the antibody batches, dilutions, and exposure settings used in these experiments have similar sensitivities for detecting COX-1 vs. COX-2. Other limitations of their study included quantitative comparisons of immunohistochemistry to infer differential enzyme activity and varied use by COXs of high concentrations of substrate.
We first reported that COX-2 was the dominant contributor to PGI2 biosynthesis, measuring its urinary metabolite, 2,3-dinor 6-keto PGF1? (PGIM), by MS in volunteers administered nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that differed in selectivity for inhibition of COX-2. Subsequently, we confirmed that PGIM was markedly suppressed by global deletion or inhibition of COX-2 in mice, consistent with results of Kirkby et al. (1). However, the authors claimed PGIM is not reflective of vascular PGI2, reporting that infusion of a vascular stimulant, bradykinin, evokes COX-1–derived immunoreactive 6-keto PGF1?, but not PGIM, in mice. However, they failed to cite our previous work that systemic infusion of either PGI2 (3) or bradykinin (4) markedly increases urinary PGIM (and 6-keto PGF1? from which it is derived) in humans."

NM (1) indicate that life persists in spite of inevitable aging; we instead argue that life persists because of aging and death. The possibility that aging is imperative for the survival of a species, and hence a universal target for selection, was neglected by NM. It is not that evolution is bypassed, as claimed by Mitteldorf and Fahy (5), but that the entire life cycle is subject to optimization through natural selection (6), including aging and death."

(1) is not able to differentiate between D2HG and L2HG. The gain-of-function mutations in IDH1/2 enzymes result in genesis of neomorph enzymes that produce vast amounts solely of D2HG, but these neomorph enzymes do not produce L2HG. The measurements of serum 2-HG in the report by Wang et al. (1) is not corrected for the endogenous serum levels of L2HG, which in healthy individuals is equal to or exceeds the level of D2HG. As a consequence, minor increases in the serum levels of D2HG might be missed and increases of L2HG might yield false-positive results."

(1) asserts that it is a response to several papers, which, according to the authors (1), imply that “motions along conformational coordinates play an important role in the chemical step” (1). Because ref. 1 and most of the cited papers in ref. 1 [references 3,6,7, and 14 in Pisliakov et al. (1)] are concerned with adenylate kinase (AdK), my comments refer to this enzyme. AdK has an open state, to which the substrates bind and from which the products are released, as well as a closed state, in which catalysis takes place. None of these cited references are concerned with the chemical reaction or suggest that there is coupling between the closing/opening conformational transitions and the chemistry; catalysis in these papers refers to the overall rate and not to the chemical step.

(1) project a 5-fold increase in the frequency of tree die-off in piñon (Pinus edulis) under drought in the southwestern United States due to elevated temperature alone. Their study is based on 10 excavated individuals grown in containers and exposed to complete drought under either ambient or elevated temperature (+4.3 °C, 5 replicates). Trees experiencing higher temperatures died 7 weeks earlier than control trees. The authors explain this by a trend to increased respiration under warmer conditions resulting in earlier carbon starvation. we do not perceive sufficient evidence for the claim of carbon starvation as a significant cause of tree death for P. edulis in a warmer world. An upscaling to ecosystem level without accounting for rooting depth in situ and true tree-size distribution is not warranted."

(1) reported that stem cell behavior on TiO2 nanotubes can be controlled solely by altering nanotube diameter. Culturing human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on a range of nanotubes with diameters between 30 and 100 nm, cell stretching and expression of osteogenic differentiation markers was highest on 100-nm nanotubes, whereas cell-adhesion rates increased with decreasing tube diameter, with a maximum at 30 nm. This finding is particularly striking in light of previous contrary reports showing that nanoscale-dependent differentiation of MSCs to osteoblasts followed in the opposite direction (2, 3). In these studies, data were presented showing that not only adhesion, proliferation, and migration, but also osteogenic differentiation of rat bone marrow MSCs were highest on 15-nm nanotubes and decreased dramatically on 70- and 100-nm nanotubes. A nanospacing of 15 nm is consistent with an optimal support of clustering of integrins, which are ?10 nm in diameter, on the nanotube grid (2, 4, 5). Also, Arnold et al. (6) have shown that nanospacing >73 nm dramatically reduced cell spreading and the formation of focal adhesions. This discrepancy is disturbing and may have escaped the attention of Oh et al. In contrast, they presented the hypothesis that cell stretching and formation of stress fibers in MSCs observed on 70-nm but not on 30-nm TiO2 nanotubes promoted differentiation into osteogenic cells, not taking into account the critical role of integrin clustering and focal-contact formation for cell differentiation. Further discussion and experimentation will be necessary to resolve this apparent conflict."

The enzyme induces massive cytidine to uridine (C? U) deamination of single-stranded retroviral DNA, resulting in DNA degradation or lethal guanine to adenine (G? A) hypermutation (1). Hepadnaviruses, including hepatitis B virus (HBV), replicate by reverse transcription of a pregenomic RNA intermediate inside nucleocapsids, placing them into the family of retroelements (2). These observations, along with an earlier report describing G? A hypermutations in natural HBV variants (3), raise the question of whether HBV represents another potential target for A3G. Turelli et al. showed that this is indeed the case (4). Surprisingly, however, inhibition of viral pregenome packaging rather than induction of G? A hypermutations was identified as the main antiviral mechanism. No significant nucleotide changes were detected in a total of 40 polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–amplified HBV clones derived from cotransfected Huh7 hepatoma cells. Turelli et al. discussed the possibility that A3G-mediated HBV editing may occur in a different cellular context."

Moreover, the phylogenetic analysis of a concatenation of these protein sequences suggests that the Mimivirus emerges at the base of the eukaryotic branch in a tree of species from the three domains of life: eukaryotes, bacteria, and archaea [figure 3 in (1)].

Funes et al. (6) argued for a green algal ancestry based on analysis of the cox2 gene, which encodes COXII, a subunit of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV of the mitochondrial respiratory chain). Apicomplexan parasites are unusual in that COXII is encoded in the nucleus (7). In all other organisms studied, with the notable exceptions of certain green algae and leguminous plants, COXII is encoded by the mitochondrial genome (8, 9). Intriguingly, the COXII protein of apicomplexan parasites comprises two polypeptides corresponding to the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal domains of the canonical COXII. The two domains are encoded by two nuclear genes, cox2a and cox2b (7). This gene separation also occurs in certain green algae, where it appears that the cox2 gene split in the mitochondrial DNA before cox2a and cox2b transferred to the nucleus (6). Funes et al. (6) presented a phylogeny of COXII indicating that apicomplexan genes are most closely related to the cox2 genes of green algae. They further suggested that apicomplexa acquired their split cox2a and cox2b genes through lateral gene transfer (presumably nucleus to nucleus) from the endosymbiotic (green) alga that gave rise to the plastid."

The disorder known as Ammon's horn sclerosis (AHS) is characterized by pronounced cell loss and gliosis in various regions of the hippocampal formation, leaving the subiculum generally intact (1, 2). Given the hypothesis that epileptic activity is generated within the hippocampal formation when the CA3 and CA1 regions are damaged or even absent, it is feasible that the adjacent subiculum is uniquely responsible for the generation of limbic seizures. Using multielectrode recordings in hippocampal brain slices of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and hippocampal sclerosis, Cohen et al. (3) detected spontaneous, rhythmic spikes in the subiculum— but rarely in the CA3 or CA1 regions. This activity closely resembled the discharges seen on the electroencephalograms (EEGs) of these patients. Cohen et al. (3) therefore concluded that in patients with AHS, deafferentation of the subiculum initiates an epileptogenic plasticity that includes changes in glutamatergic or ?-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic signaling."

Thomas et al. then extrapolated “the CO2 uptake by the North Sea to the global scale” and inferred a net oceanic uptake of atmospheric CO2 by coastal oceans of 0.4 Pg C year–1. A previous global extrapolation based on limited observations in the East China Sea (ECS) suggested an even greater air-sea CO2 flux of 1.0 Pg C year–1 in the world's continental shelf (4).

Notwithstanding positive complexity–stability relationships under specific model conditions (3), population persistence in large and complex natural food webs remains a long-standing dilemma in ecology. Certain distributions of fixed interaction strengths in model networks (4) and empirical food webs (5) appear to reduce but not invert the negative effect of complexity on network stability. More recently, Kondoh (6) examined the consequences of variable interaction strengths by modeling consumer species adaptively switching food sources. These models inverted the negative complexity–stability relationship and generated extremely complex yet surprisingly stable networks. These results, if generally applicable to ecological systems, would mark a profound paradigm shift within the diversity–stability debate and environmental biology."

This high-resolution study demonstrated that, using multilocus information only, the individuals of these populations could be subdivided into five stable genetic clusters that correspond to five major geographic regions: sub-Saharan Africa, the Americas, Oceania, EastAsia, and Eurasia (Europe, the Middle East, Central and South Asia). The study also partitioned the total genetic variance into components based upon differences between individuals within populations, between populations within regions, and between these five regions [table 1 in (1)]. Surprisingly, Rosenberg et al. (1) found very small differences between regions— only 4 to 5.7% of total diversity depending on regional sampling intensity, which is roughly half that of previous estimates inferred from molecular markers (2–4) (Table 1). Although the authors attributed that odd result to differences in sampling coverage among studies, we note that they did not base their analysis on the specific stepwise mutation model prevailing at STR loci, which is characterized by recurrent mutations. Ignoring the possibility that the same allelic type found in different individuals or populations may be derived from different evolutionary processes is known to lead to biased estimates of genetic structure (5–7)."

Under this argument, large organisms, which tend to have small Ne, also exhibit larger (complex) genomes, and the small size of bacterial genomes reflects their position at the extreme large end of the range for Ne. Genome size can vary among bacteria by at least an order of magnitude, but the fraction of noncoding DNA is consistently low (?15%). Consequently, larger bacterial genomes are expected to result from more selection, because they maintain more functional DNA. Indeed, large genome size in bacteria commonly has been considered an adaptation to changing environments (2–6). Furthermore, small Ne in symbiotic bacteria appears to result in reduced genomes through gene loss (7, 8). Thus, the relation between Ne and genome size in bacteria is, if anything, expected to be the opposite of that proposed by Lynch and Conery (1)."

Nevertheless, Blackburn et al. (5) recently concluded that much of the variation in avian extinction rates across 220 oceanic islands could be explained by a strong positive correlation with the number of exotic predatory mammal species established since European arrival. Furthermore, this conclusion was made without explicitly quantifying the degree to which other potentially intercorrelated drivers of extinction risk (notably habitat conversion) covaried with introduction success.

Recently, an elegant report by Chung et al. (1) shed some light on this enigma for PD, showing that nitric oxide (NO), a free-radical gas that can injure neurons, chemically combines through a reaction known as S-nitrosylation with the protein parkin, a ubiquitin E3 ligase that is known to cause some forms of PD when mutated. These authors also found that overexpression of parkin rescued neuronal cell lines under tissue-culture conditions subjected to proteasome inhibition and that this protective effect was abrogated by S-nitrosylation of parkin, thus supporting the pathophysiological relevance of this chemical reaction. Additionally, a hallmark of sporadic PD is the formation of ubiquitinated inclusions of misfolded proteins known as Lewy bodies. However, Chung et al. found that S-nitrosylation of parkin decreased its E3 ligase activity, thereby inhibiting ubiquitination and Lewy-body formation. Hence, these findings do not fully account for the signs encountered in sporadic PD."

International evaluation of an AI system for breast cancer screening","	

Hide abstract
Screening mammography aims to identify breast cancer at earlier stages of the disease, when treatment can be more successful1. Despite the existence of screening programmes worldwide, the interpretation of mammograms is affected by high rates of false positives and false negatives2. Here we present an artificial intelligence (AI) system that is capable of surpassing human experts in breast cancer prediction. To assess its performance in the clinical setting, we curated a large representative dataset from the UK and a large enriched dataset from the USA. We show an absolute reduction of 5.7% and 1.2% (USA and UK) in false positives and 9.4% and 2.7% in false negatives. We provide evidence of the ability of the system to generalize from the UK to the USA. In an independent study of six radiologists, the AI system outperformed all of the human readers: the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) for the AI system was greater than the AUC-ROC for the average radiologist by an absolute margin of 11.5%.

Here we report that mouse fibroblasts lacking all three mammalian dynamin proteins (DNM1, DNM2 and DNM3)6 (dynamin triple-knockout cells), as well as cells with knockdown of DNM2 only, do not display defects in mitochondrial fission or mitochondrial hyperfusion, which were readily detected after knockdown of DRP1, even in the dynamin triple-knockout cells. The same was observed when examining peroxisomal fission (mitochondria and peroxisomes share the fission machinery7). Thus, our data show that DRP1 is essential for mitochondrial and peroxisomal fission, whereas DNM1–DNM3 are dispensable."

Kossin1 showed that tropical-cyclone translation speed (TCS) has decreased globally by 10% over the period 1949–2016 and stated that this is consistent with the expected changes in atmospheric circulation forced by anthropogenic warming. However, we question the robustness of his conclusions1 for the following reasons: (1) TCSs generally increase with the latitude of the tropical cyclones and are therefore very sensitive to the bias of tropical-cyclone detection with respect to latitude; and (2) in the pre-satellite era (1949–1965), there is a high possibility that systematic biases in the detection of tropical cyclones exist in the best-track data, which could produce spurious trends in TCS. Therefore, the slowdown of TCS stated1 may not be a real climate signal or it may be exaggerated."

Although DBH is released from sympathetic nerve endings along with noradrenaline, levels of the en- zyme in plasma do not seem to reflect accurately the degree of sympatho- adrenal activity. Plasma levels of noradrenaline mostly reflect sympa- thetic neuronal activity whence adrena- line (A) levels are indicative of adrenal medullary discharge. The con- tent of catecholamines and biosynthetic enzymes in the adrenal are presumably indices of the activity of the adrenal medulla in synthesising and releasing catecholamines. The possible role of the sympathoadrenal system in initiat- ing the increase in blood pressure in SHRs was examined by measuring levels of adrenaline and noradrenaline in the plasma and adrenal glands at the age of 4 weeks, the age at which the blood pressure of SHR begins to rise. Normotensive rats of the Wistar Kyoto strain (WKY) from which the SHRs were derived were used as controls. Activities of adrenal tyrosine hydroxy- lase (TH), DBH, and phenylethano- lamine-N-methyl transferase (PNMT), as well as plasma DBH, were also examined.
These observations are consistent with the view that, at 4 weeks of age, sympathetic neuronal activity in SHRs is increased, whereas adrenal medullary activity is depressed. Adrenal medul- lary activity is increased when sympa- thetic nerves are destroyed by 6- hydroxydopamine and it is likely that depressed adrenal medullary activity may be secondary to the increased sympathetic neuronal activity. The exaggerated sympathetic neuronal activity at that age may be an essential factor in the course of development of hypertension in SHRs."

Initially, the rats swim vigorously but later make only the movements necessary to keep their heads above water. In drug screening, naïve animals are given a 15-min swim on the first day, then dried and given the first of three spaced drug injections. They undergo a 5-min swimming test 24 h later in which the period of relative immobility is timed. As clinically effective antide-pressant drugs are selectively identified in this way, Porsolt et al. conclude that the behaviour evaluated represents 'lowered mood' and 'despair' in the animals. We believe this interpretation is contrary to other behavioural activity seen in the test which they do not report."

On a plot with axes x=log (2?/?), y=log G this amounts to taking raw data consisting of 23 short line segments with varying slopes scattered over the x, y plane and translating each one along y so that it lies as close as possible to the line y=2x, a procedure guaranteed to produce a better looking fit as the total range covered by the data increases.

Spiperone, and certain other neuroleptic drugs, apparently interact with high affinity at both DA and 5-HT receptors in the CNS; our estimates of Ka values for H-spiperone binding in rat striatum (K=0.25 nM) and medial frontal cortex (Ka = 0.5 nM) indicate only a small difference in the affinity of spiperone binding at these different sites (DA and 5-HT); in human tissue the Ka for these two areas is, in fact, the same (Ka=0.5 nM). Similarly, as reported previously, the neuroleptic drug butaclamol interacts potently and stereoselectively at both these sites. Figure 1b shows that specific binding of H-spiperone, defined as that displaced by 1 µM (+)-butaclamol, is detectable in homogenates of both striatum and medial frontal cortex although (+)-butaclamol is slightly less potent in inhibiting H- spiperone binding in the cortical pre- parations. Thus, the use of the isomers of butaclamol to define 'specific' binding of H-spiperone exclusively to CNS DA receptors would clearly yield misleading results.

The highly selective displacement of H-spiperone from its binding sites in striatum by the DA agonist ADTN, makes this drug the most suitable for defining DA receptor binding in rat and human brain."

Second, we reformulate the 2017 results2 using two-parameter logistic regression (that is, one neuron) and obtain the same performance as that of the 13,451-parameter DNN.

Their conclusion that the North Sea Rift subsided in response to an extension of the crust by 110 km, 50-80 km of which occurred during the mid-Jurassic-early Cretaceous, is at variance with reflection seismic data acquired by the petroleum industry which indicate an extension of only 20-30 km at the base Zechstein Salt level.

In the central North Sea, the Zechstein Salt forms part of the pre-rift sequence and its base is a regionally correlative stratigraphical and seismic marker. Thus the extension mapped at this level gives an upper limit to the amount of extension that can have occurred during the Mesozoic rifting stage of the North Sea. Amounts of extension by faulting at the base Zechstein Salt level are probably 20-25 km, but could be as large as 30 km. It is very unlikely, however, that a multi- tude of additional faults, undetectable on multichannel seismic reflection data, could account for the doubling or quad- rupling of this amount as required by the stretching model²."

The lack of such a correlation is then treated as a corroboration of the model¹. However, as RDH cannot be falsified regardless of whether there is a correlation or not, this prediction is useless for testing the hypothesis. Here I will identify and evaluate one prediction that is an invariable consequence of RDH: when the temporal variation is such that access to a given patch is vital to the territory owners, then all group members are expected to exploit this patch simultaneously."

(parts per hundred million) SO. Bleasdale grew the same variety of ryegrass in greenhouses ventilated with polluted air from out-of-doors on a suburban site in Manchester and com- pared the growth with that in a green- house ventilated with purified air. There were reductions in the dry weight of the plants amounting to 57% in the polluted atmosphere, even though the SO: concentrations were below 3 ?.?. hm. for 39 out of 42 d and the daily means did not rise above 9 p.p.hm. at any time. Bleasdale's data appear to show that S23 ryegrass is more sensitive to SO2 than is apparent from the study by Bell and Clough. This discrepancy may be the result of their having performed experiments in different conditions, but it may equally have resulted from Bell and Clough's simulated SO2 pollution rather than polluted air from outside. In Bleasdale's experiments other air pollutants would also have been present. One such is NO2. This is found in polluted atmospheres because NO is produced by combination when fossil fuels are burnt, and is quickly oxidised in air to NO2. We have recently completed some experiments in which the combined effects of SO2 and NO pollution on photosynthesis in the pea, p.p.hm. and above of both SO, and NO were found to produce visible lesions on intact plants. Visible injury to crop plants after simultaneous exposure to SO2 and NO2 has been reported pre- viously³.
Our data suggest that combined effects of SO and NO might explain the growth inhibition caused by urban pollution, and that this possibility should be considered in future studies."

If 'causal' means a link that runs one way only, the implica- tion is to deny the possibility of the inverse type of relation. There is evidence, in fact, that learning to read improves understand- ing of the phonological structure of speech and hence ability to manipulate it at the level of phonetic segments.

Here we report that LATS1/2 are required to maintain ER? expression, as deletion of LATS1/2 abolishes ESR1 mRNA and protein in breast, endometrium and Fallopian tube epithelial cells in a manner dependent on LATS kinase activity as well as YAP and TAZ. Consistently, LATS1/2 deletion selectively inhibits growth of ER?+, but not ER??, breast cancer cells—thus revealing a role for LATS1/2 in breast cancer, and a functional crosstalk between Hippo signalling and ER?."

They then compare the means and variances of six previous ocean acidification studies in fish with a data distribution that is derived from a multi-species compilation of their own data to conclude that the results of previous studies are statistically improbable. However, Clark et al.1 did not closely repeat previous studies, as they did not replicate key species, used different life stages and ecological histories and changed methods in important ways that reduce the likelihood of detecting the effects of ocean acidification."

Nucleotide sequence of cassava latent virus DNA","STANLEY AND GAY¹ recently reported the determination of the complete nucleo tide sequences of the two circular DNA molecules (DNAs 1 and 2) that make up the genome of cassava latent virus (CLV), a member of the geminivirus group. Several open reading frames (ORFs) capable of encoding proteins of molecular weights greater than 10,000 were identified in both strands of DNAs 1 and 2. Interestingly, two ORFs which are capable of encoding proteins of similar sizes (molecular weights 30,100 and 29,200) are present at equivalent positions on DNAs 1 and 2. We have compared the amino acid sequences of these proteins by a computer-assisted method described previously and found that they are closely related (Fig. 1). Of all the positions com- pared in the aligned sequences, 43% are occupied by residues that are identical or chemically similar (gaps were considered as substitutions between dissimilar amino acids regardless of their length). Further- more, a statistical test shows that the simi- larity between the aligned sequences is highly significant, with a probability of occurrence by chance of 4.3×10-6. The presence of such extensive sequence simi- larity suggests that like the ORF of DNA 1, which is known to code for the coat protein of CLV (ref. 1 and J. Stanley, personal communication), the ORF of DNA 2 also encodes a functional protein. Although no such extensive sequence similarities were found for other ORFs, the present result, together with the simi- larity in size of the two viral DNAs and the fact that they share a very similar non-coding segment in common¹, also suggests that the bipartite viral genome has evolved from a single common ances- tral DNA."

Such an action does not readily account for the accentuation by pentobarbitone of inhibitions mediated by GABA in the mammalian central nervous system, except by antagonism of an as yet undetected endogenous GABA antagonist.
In confirmation of Bowery and Dray', pentobarbitone (10-60 nA) partially reversed the antagonism by BMC of the inhibition of cell firing by GABA. With most neurones, however, in the absence of BMC, pentobarbitone ejected with the same or even lower electrophoretic currents enhanced submaximal inhibition of firing by GABA. Furthermore, the inhibitory action of electrophoretic glycine on many cells was also enhanced, but not to the same extent as that of GABA."

They demonstrate a spike in harvests in 2016–2018, and use the short-term rise to infer a long-term trend of increasing harvests, causing them to question the viability of European forests remaining a terrestrial carbon sink in the future.

We feel that this argument is misinformed and, together with their analysis, leads Ceccherini et al.1 to several errors in their conclusions."

They detach themselves from their byssus, leave the substratum, are transported again by the water and re-attach on a new substratum. Like Sigurdsson et al., we observed long mucous threads on young mussels and compared the drift- ing at the end of a long thread with the gossamer flight of young spiders, but believed that the aberrant primary byssus thread was involved chiefly in the settlement of the young. We tested this assumption. We placed a tuft of the alga Polysiphonia with many attached mussels in a transparent annular tank (diameter 1 m) in which a constant rotating current was generated. Four small racks with 1.5 m of nylon thread wound around them were placed perpendicular to the current. After 1 d some of the mussels, usually some hundreds, had resettled from the alga on to the threads."

This increased carbon sink estimate comes from a CO2 flux inversion, in which an atmospheric chemistry transport model (CTM) and data assimilation methods are used to estimate surface fluxes optimally consistent with observed atmospheric CO2 gradients. The authors argue that this upward revision of the estimated Chinese land sink is robust considering the uncertainty estimate provided by the inverse modelling technique; however, that uncertainty estimate does not account for systematic errors in the CTM, a priori fluxes and the assimilated data.

In a previous study, Gerlach et al.1 identified an alternative glycan modification on WTA, which is shown to be poorly immunogenic and helps to subvert antibody recognition, and conclude that vaccines that are directed against glycosylated WTA may fail against many pandemic MRSA clones. However, here we show that this alternative WTA epitope actually represents a highly dominant antigen in the reactive antibody pool against S. aureus in humans. In addition, another research group demonstrated that WTA–protein conjugates had strong immunogenicity in mice2. Therefore, we believe that WTA should not be discarded as an antigen for vaccines that target S. aureus and urge scientists from academic institutions as well as pharmaceutical industry to continue their efforts in this area."

In a ground-breaking discovery, Liddle and co-workers synthesized a D3h complex with rare thorium (Th)?Th bonds2. Studying the electronic structure of a neutral singlet model system, K2[{Th(C8H8)Cl2}3] or 3?, showed that the molecule has a delocalized highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) between three Th atoms akin to a three-centre–two-electron bond. Using nucleus independent chemical shift (NICS)3 computations and according to the pattern of the NICS scan plot4 of 3?, the authors suggest that the molecule is a ?-aromatic species, as reflected in the title of their paper; but we question whether this molecule is an aromatic one."

Recently, Renard and Tilman1 reported that crop diversity, calculated as the exponential value of the Shannon diversity index of harvested areas of 176 crops, stabilizes national food production. Here we show that crop asynchrony—that is, asynchronous production trends between different crops2—is an even better predictor of agricultural production stability than is crop diversity. Our finding suggests that asynchrony is one important property that can explain why a higher crop diversity supports the stability of national food production, and that it should be considered in strategies to stabilize agricultural production through crop diversification."

Whilst self-portraits tended to show more of the right side of the face (61% of those examined), male portraits tended to show more of the left side of the face (56%) and female portraits showed an even stronger bias towards the left (68%).
In an analysis of 335 portraits by Rembrandt, the same authors found that the frequency with which more of the left face is shown increases progressively across the following categories of sitter: self, male kin, male non-kin, female kin, female non-kin. To explain this it was suggested that the categories represent positions on a dimension 'socially like myself-socially unlike myself' along which Rembrandt placed his sitters.

However, there was a discrepancy between the studies: we found that TRPM2 contributed to the thermal response of isolated somatosensory neurons1,3, whereas Vandewauw et al.2 proposed that TRPA1—and not TRPM2—was the only thermally activated ion channel in somatosensory neurons apart from TRPV1 and TRPM32.

In fact, contrary to Dill et al., there is surprising agreement between their calculations and our model based on physical organic data2.3. Among the more important features of micellar structure that we have specified repeatedly are: (1) a rough micelle surface; (2) 'fatty patches' leading to an abundance of hydrocarbon-water contact where waterinsoluble materials bind hydrophobically; (3) transient water-filled cavities; (4) chain bending and looping that place terminal methyls near the surface; (5) a water-free hydrocarbon core of <50% of the micellar volume.

There are various reasons why the evidence reported should be treated as a good deal less definite than the article implies."
